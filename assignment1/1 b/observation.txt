The Barnsley fern has been generated using 4 affined affine transformations named as m1, m2, m3, m4.
(reference : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern)

1. The transformation matrices are as follows: 
    a) applying m1 transformation will produce a line / steam of the fern.
    b) applying m2 transformation will move the fern slightly up and right direction. 
    c) applying m3 transformation will rotate the fern in the left producing the leaves of left side
    d) applying m4 transformation will flip then rotate the fern in the right side 
    producing the leaves of right side. 
    
2.  From one point (0, 0, 0, 1), "verticeNo" of vertices have been generated recursively 
    in the CreateVertexBuffer() and point primitive has been used to draw the fern. 

3.  First the two ferns have been scaled by 0.2 in all axis.
    Then the refelction of 2nd fern is made by the y axis. 
    Then first fern is translated to (-0.5, -1, 0) and the second fern is translated to (0.5, -1, 0)
    to make it a horizontal flip.
