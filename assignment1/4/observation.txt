1.  After projecting the mesh at center, the mesh has been cut in the geometry shader.

2.  The plane parallel to xz plane has been taken as the plane to slice the mesh. 
    Equation of the plane used is y = yaxis where yaxis is the variable denoting distance 
    from the xz plane. 

3.  Using geometry shader the triangles with the three vertices have been drawn only if either 
    all the vertices of the triangle are above this plane or 
    all the vertices of the triangle are below this plane.

4.  In case of the lower half, a translation of -0.1 along Y axis has been used to show 
    they are detached from one another. 

5.  The FPS is 47.62 but while applying camera movement through keyboard, it lowers to 
    the range of 32 to 38.
