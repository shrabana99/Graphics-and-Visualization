1.  The ball has been drawn initially with a radius 1 and centered at the origin and scaled properly 
    to make it small. The box is drawn from (-1, -1, -1) to (1,1,1).  

2.  To make the ball move, class Motion has been defined where the direction of velocity vector 
    can be generated randomly or a predefined direction of veclocity can be used. 

3.  With a given speed, a translation will be applied to the center of the ball as well as 
    all the points on that ball. 

4.  If the distance between center of the ball and any 6 planes equals to the radius of the ball, 
    the ball has touched the box. 
    The ball is stopped in the space for 5 frames to give it a bouncing effect.

5.  If a ball is touching a plane, the ball is reflected back with the same velocity.  

6.  A continuous rotation to the whole scene is implemented by placing the camera at a fixed 
    distance which focuses at the origin then rotates around the box with a fixed speed.
